__Build instructions__

1. Install [node](http://nodejs.org) (the version used to build and run this code was node v4.3.0).   
2. Clone this directory, and run `npm install` in your terminal of choice to install the needed node modules (mainly express and its middleware).  
3. Run `npm start` from the terminal to begin the expressJS server that runs the backend endpoints, as well as serves the frontend HTML.  
4. In your browser of choice, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the content. Possible links are:  
   * `http://localhost:3000`  
   * `http://localhost:3000/req1`  
   * `http://localhost:3000/req2`  
   * `http://localhost:3000/req3`  
5. When finished, end the running node script from step 3 in your terminal of choice.
